### Module:

	A module is a grouping of functions and data. 
	A module defines an interface which is used for communication with the rest of the environement.
	Typically in object-oriented context, a module refers to a "Class" but that is not necessary for 
	other paradigms.

	Note:
	Methods and functions could qualify as such groupings. They have internal state(in the sense that they define private variables) 
	and pieces of code that may alter that state to produce a result.

### Code Smell:

	In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program 
	that possibly indicates a deeper problem. Determining what is and is not a code smell
	is subjective, and varies by language, developer, and development methodology.

	Note:
	The term was popularised by Kent Beck on WardsWiki in the late 1990s. 
	Usage of the term increased after it was featured in the 1999 book 
	Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler.
	It is also a term used by agile programmers.
