### Module:

	A module is a grouping of functions and data. 
	A module defines an interface which is used for communication with the rest of the environement.
	Typically in object-oriented context, a module refers to a "Class" but that is not necessary for 
	other paradigms.

	Note:
	Methods and functions could qualify as such groupings. They have internal state and pieces of code 
	that alter that may state to produce a result.
