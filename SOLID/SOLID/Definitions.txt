Module:

The SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected.
The use of the word "Class" does not imply that these principles are only applicable to object-oriented software.
A class is simply a coupled grouping of functions and data. Every software system has such groupings, whether they are called classes or not.
The SOLID principles apply to those groupings.

A module is a grouping of functions and data. A module defines an interface which is used for communication with the rest of the environement.
Typically in object-oriented context, a module refers to a "Class" but that is not necessary for other paradigms.
Methods and functions could qualify as such groupings. They have internal state and pieces of code that alter that state to produce a result.
