#### Example 1

Imagine we get a Requirement from out beloved PO/PA to build an application 
that can calculate the total area of a collection of rectangles

We do that very very easily.

###### TheBadAreaCalculator

Now our beloved PO/PA wonders if we couldn extend it so that it could 
calculate the area of not only rectangles but of circles as well.
   
###### TheBadAreaCalculatorWhichRequiresModificationModified

By this time we have already imagined that our beloved PO/PA has already 
come up with a new cool feature that has something to do with triangles
In addition we have detected that we have violated the Open-Closed Principle
because we modified our module in order to accomodate the new requirement.
