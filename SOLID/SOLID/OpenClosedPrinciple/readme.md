### *O* - Open-Closed Principle (*OCP*)

##### History

	The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) was coined in 1988 by Bertrand Meyer.
	it first appeared in his 1988 book Object Oriented Software Construction.

	Meyer’s original approach was to use inheritance as a core mechanism to achieve this.

> A sofware artifact should be open for extension and closed for modification

##### Definition

> In object-oriented programming, the open–closed principle states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) 
should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended 
without modifying its source code.

 *any ideas? How can we extend the functionality without modifying the code ? Sounds impossible.*
