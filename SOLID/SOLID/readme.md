# SOLID 

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
2. **O**pen-Closed Principle
3. **L**iskov's Substitution Principle
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### History

First introduced in 2000 in a paper called Design Principles and Design Patterns.
The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and 
instructor Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

But the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

### Why are they useful?

The SOLID principles tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, 
and how those classes should be interconnected.
The use of the word "Class" does not imply that these principles are only applicable to 
object-oriented software.
A class is simply a coupled grouping of functions and data. 
Every software system has such groupings, whether they are called classes or not. 
The SOLID principles apply to those groupings.

_**Its all about being agile.**_ We need to be agile in every aspect of our work. Even in the code itself.
These principles help us write code in a way that it can be easily changed/adapted to new requiments.

I think of them as well defined guidelines and not as hard dogmatic rules.
In the context of our work it is not always possible to follow them to the letter.
We might work in an old project. We might interruct with code that is there already,
that someone else has already written, rendering it unrealistic to apply those principles.

In any case if we know them and we have them in our mind they will for sure guide
us to better implementations and help us identify potential problems in our codebase.
We can also use them to argue on whether a particular approach/implementation is better or not than
an other one.
