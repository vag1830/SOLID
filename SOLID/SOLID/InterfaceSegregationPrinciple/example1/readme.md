#### Example 1

A coffee machine, Yaaaaaaay !!!

###### CoffeeMachine

The CoffeeMachine is a perfectrly good machine. It does exactly what one would expect a coffee machine to do.
One can add coffee and then make a coffee drink.
   
###### BadCoffeeMachine

New Feature time for the coffee machine. We need a coffee machine that makes Espresso.

###### GoodCoffeeMachine

It is not always clear and easy to spot these things.
Also it depends a lot on the design of the system. 

For example imagine a Coffee machine that can do both filtered coffee and espress.

which way would you go then ? 
  * one interface containing all 
  * multiple interfaces
